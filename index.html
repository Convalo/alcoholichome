<p>We learn by example. We also learn through the environment to which we are exposed.
In the world of alcoholism, experts have said that children who grow up in an alcoholic home, and are exposed to alcohol at young ages, are more than likely to become drinkers later in life. </p>

<p>But that’s only part of the problem. Growing up in an alcoholic home can have other implications as well.</p>

<p>One implication is your behavior.</p>

<p>While you may feel that the behavior that goes on inside your home when the entire home is under the influence is normal, in most instances there is no normalcy to compulsive anger and/or outbursts such as is the case within some drinking environments, including households. </p>

<p>Nor would you fear that what you say might be misinterpreted, and in turn, cause a backlash toward you.</p>

<p>This, in many instances, is not normal behavior, particularly in an environment where there is little to no drinking. </p>

<p>An alcoholic home may have much different standards and practices, or in other cases, may have no morals at all.</p>

<p>Part of this behavior comes from the prevailing fact that alcohol dictates the atmosphere in your house. With that in mind, many types of behaviors which are not considered as “normal” can take place. These include1:</p>

<p>• Have to Guess What Normal Is
When you go into a new or unfamiliar situation, do you stand back and watch how others do things before you try it yourself? Do you ever fail to respond to a social invitation because you aren't comfortable around people you don't know?
• Have Difficulty Having Fun
Do you sometimes feel that nothing good ever happens to you? Do you find it hard to get excited about upcoming holidays, birthdays or celebrations? Could that be because those events were always turned into disasters by the alcoholic?</p>

<p>• Have Difficulty with Intimate Relationships
Have you ever broken off a relationship because you felt the other person was getting "too close?" Do you have problems making and keeping any long-term relationships? Could it be that you simply can't allow yourself to trust someone that much?
• Have Trust Issues
Can't understand how others can be so trusting, especially of people they barely know? Do you think they are being naive or foolish? Could that be a result of all the lies and broken promises that you experienced as a child from the people whom you were supposed to be able to trust the most?</p>

<p>• Become Terrified of Abandonment
Ever feel a bit panicked when someone you have known for a while decides to move away? Have you ever clung to a relationship from which you've really received very little? Is it possible that your fear of being alone is greater than your need to protect yourself from those who might take advantage of you?</p>

<p>• Become Frightened of Angry People
When people raise their voices or scream does it actually frighten you? Have you ever found yourself putting up with an unacceptable situation, just because you wanted to avoid the confrontation that it would require to change it? Do you avoid conflict at all costs?</p>

<p>• Constantly Seek Approval
Upon completing a project or task, do you find that you do not find any satisfaction until someone else acknowledges your accomplishment? Can someone's expression of dissatisfaction or even a disapproving look send you into a gloomy mood? Do you constantly look for approval from others?</p>

<p>Of course, having learned the living style and rituals of an alcoholic home can result in your own adverse behavior.</p>

<p>This behavior can involve not just the actions listed above, but even the simpler and seemingly innocuous behavior of needing a drink when you get home from work. Or have one or two drinks with dinner and then one more as a night cap.</p>

<p>In short, this is addictive behavior, all of which can be cultured in one’s home, even if that person does not drink.</p>

<p>The point is, as difficult as it may seem, you should try to avoid this behavior as best as you can. Tell yourself that how people live in alcoholic homes, even your own family, is not by any stretch of the imagination normal, even if no one quite understands what normal is.</p>
